  <p>This Python script is for a voice interface chatbot named Jervis. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model to respond to user input. The user can interact with the chatbot through speech, and the chatbot responds with text and/or speech. The conversation can be saved as an MP3 file and emailed to a specified address. The conversation is also logged to a MongoDB database.</p>

## üßê About

The Todoist CLI is a Python script that interacts with the Todoist API to provide a command-line interface for managing your Todoist tasks.

The script uses the `todoist-python` package to interact with the Todoist API and the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from a .env file. The environment variable `TODOIST_API_KEY` is used to authenticate with the Todoist API.

When you run the script, it displays a menu of options for managing your Todoist tasks. You can list, add, update, close, reopen, and delete tasks. You can also manage projects and comments. In addition, you can open the Todoist web app to view today's tasks and your active projects.

Here's how it works:

1. The script loads your Todoist API key from a .env file using `python-dotenv`.
2. It creates a `TodoistAPI` object using your API key.
3. It displays a menu of options and asks you to choose an option.
4. Depending on your choice, it calls a function to perform the chosen operation. For example, if you choose to list tasks, it calls the `get_tasks` method on the `TodoistAPI` object and then prints the tasks.
5. If an operation requires user input, such as adding a task, it prompts you to enter the necessary information.
6. After performing an operation, it goes back to step 3, unless you choose to exit the script.

This script provides a quick and easy way to manage your Todoist tasks from your terminal. It's especially useful if you prefer using the command line over a graphical user interface, or if you want to automate your task management with scripts.
