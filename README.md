This is a robust and user-friendly PowerShell script that provides a simple yet powerful todo list functionality. It allows you to add, remove, and list todo items, and it also supports notifications.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repo-link>`.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the `Todo.ps1` script.
3. Run the   `.\install.ps1` script in PowerShell.
4. This will check if you have powershell installed.
5. This script will then check if the module for making notifications.
6. The script will then ask you for the PATH of where you saved these files to E.G. "C:\Users\You\todo" Replace `<path to Todo.ps1>` with the actual path to the `Todo.ps1` script.
7. This script will then add the PATH to the PowerShell profile file, this is so you can just type "todo list" without running the file from it's folder all the time. See Usage for more details.
8. Now the script is ready to be used on the terminal. Type "todo hello" and
9. Commands can be found by typing "todo --help" or see below.
