        Todoist is a powerful task management app that helps you organize your life. With Todoist, you can create tasks and projects, set due dates and priorities, and even assign tasks to others. Todoist syncs across all your devices, so you can manage your tasks wherever you are. It also integrates with many other apps and services, including Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, Amazon Alexa, and more. Whether you're managing a team, writing an epic screenplay, or just making a grocery list, Todoist is there to help you achieve more every day.
</p>

<br>
<br>

The Todoist CLI is a Python script that interacts with the Todoist API to provide a command-line interface for managing your Todoist tasks.

The script uses the `todoist-python` package to interact with the Todoist API and the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from a .env file. The environment variable `TODOIST_API_KEY` is used to authenticate with the Todoist API.

When you run the script, it displays a menu of options for managing your Todoist tasks. You can list, add, update, close, reopen, and delete tasks. You can also manage projects and comments. In addition, you can open the Todoist web app to view today's tasks and your active projects.

Here's how it works:

1. The script loads your Todoist API key from a .env file using `python-dotenv`.
2. It creates a `TodoistAPI` object using your API key.
3. It displays a menu of options and asks you to choose an option.
4. Depending on your choice, it calls a function to perform the chosen operation. For example, if you choose to list tasks, it calls the `get_tasks` method on the `TodoistAPI` object and then prints the tasks.
5. If an operation requires user input, such as adding a task, it prompts you to enter the necessary information.
6. After performing an operation, it goes back to step 3, unless you choose to exit the script.

This script provides a quick and easy way to manage your Todoist tasks from your terminal. It's especially useful if you prefer using the command line over a graphical user interface, or if you want to automate your task management with scripts.

## Idea

I had an idea if I could connect Todoist to my original todo_list program I made (Not uploaded yet) for Powershell, the Powershell todo_list was finished, and I thought if I could connect my todo_list to Todoist. This script does not do that, this script is to let you control your Todoist from the terminal or command line. This script lets you do most things available with this code. I copied and pasted all the code from the Todoist API guide, and with the help of GitHUb CoPilot we arrived at this script. Please enjoy and upgrade and own it.

## Help and Install Files Explained. More detailed instructions can be found below. Lots and lots! 

1. (todoist.py) This is the main file to run to get the todoist working in the terminal. It wont work right away as you need to install the requirements and also to get you Todoist API Key. It's Free!! If you are reading this first, then follow the steps below.  
```bash
python todoist.py
```
2. (install.py) Install the todoist script with one command. The script will ask you questions, make files for the script to work. 
```bash
python install.py
```
3. (requirements.txt) This file is for installing modules that make the script work. If you want to install manually then use this command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. (todoist_api_test.py) This will test you Todoist API Key without running the main script.
   Just add your API key to the .env file TODOIST_API_KEY="Putyourkeyinhere"
```bash
python todoist_api_test.py
```
5. (usr-bin.sh) To be able to use todoist from the command line instead of having to goto the directory then type python todoist.py. The script will enable you to just type todoist in the terminal and the script will run. This script will copy todoist.py and send a copy to /usr/local/bin/todoist. This works on Macbook (Currently testing Windows and Linux). There is a slight modification to the todoist.py file which is saved in the help_files folder, and help on Windows and Linux is also located in the folder help_files/todoist_install_help.md.
```bash
bash usr-bin.sh
```
6. (/help_files/todoist.py) This version of todoist.py is for sending into the /usr/local/bin/ folder so you can run todoist on the command line. This file will be used for usr-bin.sh.
